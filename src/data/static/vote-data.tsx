      <p>Extend POOL drip for UNI, COMP, Dai, USDC, and SUSHI Ethereum pools until the end of October. Extend prizes and drip for the POOL pool as well.</p>
      <h6>Motivation</h6>
      <p>The POOL drips for most Ethereum pools will be ending within the next 2 weeks (see details here). This proposal serves to maintain the statusquo of POOL incentives on Ethereum. However, it only extends the status quo for a relatively short amount of additional time. This is becausethe V4 prize pool will be launching in mid October and a larger incentive overhaul will be.</p>
